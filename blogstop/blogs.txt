 Hainanese chicken rice is rice that’s been lightly sautéed with aromatics and cooked in a chicken broth with green onions and ginger, then served with perfectly poached chicken and a variety of sauces. If you want to make it the right way, you cook the chicken first with green onions and ginger, then use the resulting broth to make the rice. every family tweaks the recipe to their own liking, and we’re no different. In all the years we’ve made it, our (not-so-uncommon) family trick is to sauté the rice in chicken fat for extra chicken-y goodness. This makes the rice glossy and rich, and irresistibly good. We also serve ours with green onion oil instead of the usual ginger-garlic sauce.
