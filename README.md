# BlogStop - [Web Technologies - II Project]
The main objective of Blogspot is to provide users with an interactive blogging
experience. It manages all information about the blog itself, its categories while also
providing features such as like and comment to express your opinion freely and
anonymously. We also have intelligence functionalities such as sentiment analysis
and automatic tagging to improve user experience. The user can access his blog
statistics which show with the help of graphs how well his posts are being received
by the community as well as his trend of uploading posts.
